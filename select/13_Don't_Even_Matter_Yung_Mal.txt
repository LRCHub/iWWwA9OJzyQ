I've been stacking up on hunnids,
On hunnids, on hunnids it don't even matter
Sippin' this codeine fucked up my bladder
I was on first skreet now they see me on channel
All that shit get cooked up, keep it organic
Name hoe wet make her cum out her pantys
Stuck with some cowboys like I'm from Dallas
We keep shit at the palace
Tryn' stay focused, tryn' stay balanced
I got that drip by the gallon (drip)
You know we sip on the gallon (mud)
I do my show with the cannon (scrap)
Bitch I came up where them houses abandon
I couldn't go home empty handed, naw, fuck it, I'm trappin'
I'm catching plays like many
Dope came back I was serving your granny
Nigga killed plug you will sleep on the xany

Bought me some sticks, could've bought me a Patek
Whole clip strapped like we killin' Bin laden
So many guns the feds on me bump
I told them "their props you can try, if you wanna"
Trap 24 you can buy what you wanna
They commin' iceberg, but I'm hot like a sauna
I ran that shit up gave racks to my mom
Son fin turn sixteen might buy him a hummer
These sticks bullets they spread like a ton
I spin your block and a run up
A charge of they tone
Just tryn' clear my head I got tunnel vision
Just drop the charge my lawyer do tricks
My front line don't say shit they blitz
At the top floor eating fish and gritz
So many hundreds came up

I've been stacking up on hunndinds,
On hunndinds, on hunndinds it don't even matter
Sippin' this codeine fucked up my bladder
I was on first skreet now they see me on channel
All that shit get cooked up, keep it organic
Name hoe wet make her cum out her pantys
Stuck with some cowboys like I'm from Dallas
We keep shit at the palace
Tryn' stay focused, tryn' stay balanced
I got that drip by the gallon (drip)
You know we sip on the gallon (mud)
I do my show with the cannon (scrap)
Bitch I came up where them houses abandon
I couldn't go home empty handed, naw, fuck it, I'm trappin'
I'm catching plays like many
Dope came back I was serving your granny
Nigga killed plug you will sleep on the xany

Got bloods, got loads like I'm from Cali
Can't get no sleep shit ain't got rock
Pulled up thirty D like I'm Obama
Ten straight summers no more fuckin' informers
Ain't shit sweet thing is act like bumble
I get the set, I make it triple in double
Don't talk no pillars, don't talk undercover
This money keep comin' ops know they in trouble
I keep a Glock why the fuck Ima touch
Don't gotta pay shit know I get it with most
I ain't never had shit, but I had me some hustle
Stay down hoe dig shit like a shovel
Bless lil bitch put a brick on my bez
Got food slide wit' me he think like the devil
Could've won five on the mother fuckin' president

I've been stacking up on hunndinds,
On hunndinds, on hunndinds it don't even matter
Sippin' this codeine fucked up my bladder
I was on first skreet now they see me on channel
All that shit get cooked up, keep it organic
Name hoe wet make her cum out her pantys
Stuck with some cowboys like I'm from Dallas
We keep shit at the palace
Tryn' stay focused, tryn' stay balanced
