Life can be heavy
Time can be scary
Days around the sun
Battles to be won
If love is war
Come crash into my vacant arms
Embrace, explore
We're supernova racing
Do I matter to you?
Do I matter to you?
Do I matter to you-ooh-ooh?
You matter to me
You matter to me
You matter and we all matter
Do I matter to you?
Do I matter to you?
Do I matter to you-ooh-ooh?
You matter to me
You matter to me
You matter and we all matter
Should we be sharing
All that we carry?
I know songs have been sung
But change is yet to come
If love is war
Come crash into my vacant arms
The space we ignore
Is the answer to our fading
Do I matter to you?
Do I matter to you?
Do I matter to you-ooh-ooh?
You matter to me
You matter to me
You matter and we all matter
Do I matter to you?
Do I matter to you?
Do I matter to you-ooh-ooh?
You matter to me
You matter to me
You matter and we all matter
Left to right
Will you take,
will you take my hand?
Hold it tight, feel the waste
As our atoms collide
Do you sing, do you sing
when you look within?
Is it faith,
is it hate pulling you back in?
Do you wanna believe
there's a war to win?
Do you wanna believe?
You matter to me
Do I matter to you?
Do I matter to you-ooh-ooh?
You matter to me
You matter to me
You matter and we all matter
Do I matter to you?
Do I matter to you?
Do I matter to you-ooh-ooh?
You matter to me
You matter to me
You matter and we all matter
Do you sing, do you sing
when you look within?
Is it faith, is it hate,
pulling you back in?
Do you wanna believe
there's a war to win?
Do you wanna believe?
You matter to me
